Task: Create a multiple-choice quiz based on the provided flashcards.

Instructions:
1. Create exactly 5 multiple-choice questions based on the flashcards content
2. Each question must:
   - Be clear and specific
   - Have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
   - Have only one correct answer
   - Include distractors that are plausible but clearly incorrect
3. Use the flashcard content to ensure accuracy
4. For image flashcards:
   - Include the image URL in the question
   - Base distractors on visual elements from the image
5. Format as a JSON object with fields:
   - "quiz": Array of question objects
   - Each question object must have:
     * "question": The question text
     * "options": Array of 4 options
     * "correct_answer": Index of correct option (0-3)
     * "explanation": Brief explanation of the correct answer
     * "image_url": URL of image (only for image-based questions)

Output Example:
{{
    "quiz": [
        {{
            "question": "What is X?",
            "options": [
                "First option about X",
                "Second option about X",
                "Third option about X",
                "Fourth option about X"
            ],
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "explanation": "Explanation about why the first option is correct"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
